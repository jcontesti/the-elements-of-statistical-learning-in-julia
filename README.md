# The Elements of Statistical Learning in Julia

As a result of the study of "The Elements of Statistical Learning" book, I will add to this repository all my notebooks written in Julia that have helped me better understand this book.

The Elements of Statistical Learning is one of the most excellent books on statistical learning of all time. Please, find more information about it at: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/.
